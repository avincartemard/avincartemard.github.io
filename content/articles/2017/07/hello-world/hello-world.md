After a week of fiddling and learning HTML and CSS on the fly, I finally managed to create a blog using [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), a static site generator powered by Python that supports Markdown and reST syntax. 

Now that I have successfully defended my PhD thesis (which I verbosely titled "Numerical Investigation of Spatial Inhomogeneities in Gravity and Quantum Field Theory"), I have decided to take some time to blog about my progress as I transition towards a career in data science. This blog will be my platform to discuss all things related to

* Machine Learning;
* the ethics of Big Data;
* coding in Python;
* physics;
* interesting books I've read;

and more. Cheers!
